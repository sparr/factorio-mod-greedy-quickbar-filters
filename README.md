# factorio-mod-greedy-quickbar-filters
A mod for the game Factorio. Causes empty filtered quickbar slots to grab items
from your inventory and other unfiltered quickbar slots.

This mod will avoid the problem where you pick an item from the quickbar, then
pick another item without hitting "Q". The base game behavior leaves the first
item in the second item's inventory slot, rather than putting it back in your
quickbar.
